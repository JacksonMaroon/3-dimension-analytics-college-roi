# Presentation Checklist (10 Minutes)

## Model Consistency Lock
- Research question: which school characteristics are associated with earnings after attendance.
- Baseline model: `MEDIAN_HH_INC` only.
- Full model: `MEDIAN_HH_INC + stem_share + completion_rate + prestige_proxy`.
- Robustness check: replace prestige proxy with `SAT_AVG`.

## Required Slide Content
- Research question and why client cares.
- Hypothesis and theory.
- One slide with regression table only (no extra text).
- Interpretation in practical terms.
- Client implications.
- Limits and next steps.

## Suggested Slide Order
1. Client + decision context.
2. Research question + directional hypothesis.
3. Theory and mechanisms.
4. Data, sample, and model setup.
5. Regression table only.
6. Coefficient and fit visuals.
7. Practical interpretation in dollars.
8. Client implications.
9. Limits + next steps.

## Language Rules
Use:
- "We find evidence that..."
- "is associated with..."
- "we find no evidence that..."

Avoid:
- "proves" or "causes"
- absolute null statements
- "just correlation"

## Final Checks
- Stay under 10 minutes.
- Keep table-only slide clean.
- Match spoken model spec to notebook/table.
- Mention robust SE and SAT robustness briefly.
- End with one clear client recommendation.
