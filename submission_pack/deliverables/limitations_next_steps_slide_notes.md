# Limits and Next Steps Slide Notes

## Limits
- Observational model: we identify associations, not causal effects.
- Missing `ADM_RATE` reduces sample size.
- Omitted variables may still affect coefficient estimates.

## Next Steps
- Add broader controls (for example school-resource and labor-market context variables).
- Compare additional prestige proxies besides admission rate and SAT.
- Run sensitivity checks on outliers and alternative model forms.
