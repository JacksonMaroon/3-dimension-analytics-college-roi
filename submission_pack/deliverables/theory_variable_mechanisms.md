# Theory to Variable Mechanisms

## STEM Share
Mechanism: Human capital channel. A higher STEM share suggests stronger exposure to technical skill pathways with higher labor-market demand. That should be associated with higher post-attendance earnings.

## Completion Rate
Mechanism: Credential completion channel. Completion raises likelihood that students finish credentials needed for better-paying roles.

## Prestige Proxy (1 - Admission Rate)
Mechanism: Signaling channel. More selective schools may provide stronger market signals to employers, which can be associated with higher wages.

## Median Household Income
Mechanism: Context channel. Household-income context can proxy differences in resources, preparation, and opportunity sets that are associated with later earnings.

## SAT Robustness
Mechanism test: Replacing prestige proxy with `SAT_AVG` checks whether a different academic-selectivity signal gives a similar positive association.
