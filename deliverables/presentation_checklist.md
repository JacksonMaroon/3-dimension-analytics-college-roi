# Presentation Checklist (10 Minutes)

## Required Slide Content
- Research question and why client cares.
- Hypothesis and theory.
- One slide with regression table only (no extra text).
- Interpretation and client implications.
- Limits and next steps.

## Suggested Slide Order
1. Client + decision context.
2. Research question + hypothesis.
3. Theory.
4. Data and sample.
5. Regression table only.
6. Coefficient chart.
7. Implications for client.
8. Limits + next steps.

## Language Rules (Important)
Use:
- "We find evidence that..."
- "Our results are consistent with..."
- "We find no evidence that..."

Avoid:
- "X proves/cause Y" (unless causal design justifies it)
- "X does not affect Y" (too absolute)
- "This is just correlation" (undersells regression evidence)

## Interpreting Current Coefficients
- `stem_share`: positive association with earnings.
- `completion_rate`: positive association with earnings.
- `prestige_proxy`: positive association with earnings.
- `MEDIAN_HH_INC`: positive association with earnings.

## Final Pre-Submit Checks
- Rehearse timing to stay under 10 minutes.
- Ensure table slide has no extra text.
- Keep interpretation in plain client language.
- Mention at least one limitation.
- Be explicit that findings are associational.
