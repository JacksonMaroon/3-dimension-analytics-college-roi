# Final Speaker Script (10 Minutes)

## Slide 1: Client and Question (1:00)
"We are 3 Dimension Analytics, working for a university career office. Our question is: which college characteristics are associated with higher median earnings after attendance?"

## Slide 2: Hypothesis (1:00)
"We hypothesize that STEM share, completion rate, and prestige are positively associated with earnings."

## Slide 3: Theory (1:00)
"Human capital theory supports skill and completion pathways. Signaling theory supports a prestige pathway."

## Slide 4: Data and Models (1:00)
"We use College Scorecard institution-level data. Baseline model includes median household income. Full model adds STEM share, completion rate, and prestige proxy."

## Slide 5: Regression Table Only (1:30)
"This slide reports coefficients with HC3 robust standard errors. We find evidence of positive associations for STEM share, completion rate, prestige proxy, and household income in the full model."

## Slide 6: Model Fit and Coefficients (1:30)
"Model fit improves from R^2 = 0.3400 to R^2 = 0.5025 in the full model."

## Slide 7: Practical Terms (1:30)
"Holding other variables fixed: +10 percentage points STEM share is associated with about +$3,105 in earnings, +10 points completion is associated with about +$1,493, +10 points admission rate is associated with about -$840, and +$10,000 household income is associated with about +$5,481."

## Slide 8: Robustness (0:45)
"With robust standard errors, our key signs and significance are stable. Replacing prestige proxy with SAT average still gives a positive selectivity signal and higher model fit in that subsample."

## Slide 9: Client Implications (0:45)
"The career office can prioritize STEM pathway advising, completion support, and outcomes messaging around selective high-opportunity pathways."

## Slide 10: Limits and Next Steps (0:30)
"These are associational findings, not causal estimates. Next steps are broader controls and additional robustness checks."

## Language reminders
- Say "we find evidence" and "associated with".
- Do not say "proves" or "causes".
